### 📁 File and Folder Naming Rules

- **All folder and file names must be unique.**  
  Duplicate names across the project are not allowed.

This number represents the frame index. Example: `skip_list_delete_1.txt`, `skip_list_delete_2.txt`, etc.

- **All frames must be represented using ASCII or Unicode characters only.**
- No images, binary data, or non-text formats are allowed.
